Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------

### Why?
I'm not sure.

### What is the roadmap for future development?
We are in the midst of raising a Series A. We plan to use the funding to purchase enough display advertising to increase our site visitors by 10% each month, so that our board of directors is satiated by good statistics and ignores the absurdity of paying for our own traffic.

### No, seriously what's the roadmap?
I'm sorry, we've just gone stealth. But please sign up for our newsletter and/or Twitterbook account, so that we can send you frequent updates about our stealthiness.

### You're being a dick.
Yes. Again, I'm sorry. There is no roadmap. This is just an experiment. There will be no future updates.

### Can I use and/or modify the code?
Yes. This code is released under a [WTFPL license](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).

### Do you love me?
Yes. *smooch*
